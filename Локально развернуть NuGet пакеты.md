If you want to use NuGet packages in an offline environment with Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC), you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Local NuGet Package Source

1. **Download Packages**: On a machine with internet access, use the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or the `nuget.exe` command-line tool to download the packages you need. You can do this by using the following commands:

   ```bash
   nuget install <PackageID> -Version <VersionNumber> -OutputDirectory <PathToDownload>
   ```

   Replace `<PackageID>`, `<VersionNumber>`, and `<PathToDownload>` with the appropriate values.

2. **Copy Packages**: Once you have downloaded the packages, copy the entire folder containing the `.nupkg` files to a USB drive or any other medium that you can use to transfer files to your offline machine.

### Step 2: Set Up the Offline Environment

1. **Transfer Packages**: Move the copied packages to your offline machine.

2. **Create a Local Folder**: On the offline machine, create a folder to store the NuGet packages (e.g., `C:\LocalNuGetPackages`).

3. **Copy Packages**: Place the `.nupkg` files you transferred into this folder.

### Step 3: Configure Visual Studio to Use the Local Source

1. **Open Visual Studio**: Launch Visual Studio on your offline machine.

2. **Open Package Sources**:
   - Go to `Tools` > `Options`.
   - In the Options dialog, expand the `NuGet Package Manager` section and click on `Package Sources`.

3. **Add Local Source**:
   - Click the `+` (Add) button to create a new package source.
   - Name the source (e.g., `LocalPackages`).
   - Set the source path to the folder where you placed the `.nupkg` files (e.g., `C:\LocalNuGetPackages`).
   - Click `Update` and then `OK`.

### Step 4: Install Packages from Local Source

1. **Create or Open a Project**: Open your existing project or create a new one.

2. **Manage NuGet Packages**:
   - Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select `Manage NuGet Packages`.
   - Go to the `Browse` tab.
   - Select your local package source from the dropdown list.
   - You should see the packages available in your local folder.

3. **Install Packages**: Select the package you want to install and click the `Install` button.

### Additional Tips

- **Package Dependencies**: Ensure that you have all the dependencies for any packages you are using, as NuGet will not be able to resolve them offline.
- **NuGet.config**: You can also create a `NuGet.config` file to specify the local source if you want to manage multiple sources or customize settings.
- **Backup**: Keep a backup of your downloaded packages, especially if you need to set up multiple offline environments.

By following these steps, you should be able to use NuGet packages in an offline environment with Visual Studio.
